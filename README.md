# ***Winner Winner Chicken Dinner*** 

#### ***Winner Winner Chicken Dinner*** is a multiple choice food trivia quiz game.  If the player can score more than 1000 points they win the game. Since each question is worth 100 points that means you need to get 10 correct in order to win, otherwise you can click the *Try Again* button and start over.

#### I like trivia games in general, and when I approached this project I wanted to make something fun, lighthearted, and with a food theme.  That is the origin of the name ***Winner Winner Chicken Dinner***. The overall styling (font, color scheme) of the page is meant to evoke some sort of chicken-themed restaurant or microwavable food product, and the questions are meant to be approachable, and leave the user with some random trivia facts when they complete the quiz.

#### Instructions for the game are largely self-explanatory, however here is the summary:
- Navigate to the website.
- Click on the *Start* button to begin the quiz.
- After each answer you will get a message below the game buttons saying whether your answer was correct, or incorrect. If correct, the scoreboard will increase by 100 points.
- After each question simply click the *Next* button, and try to answer the next trivia question correctly.
- When the quiz is completed, you will receive a winning message if you eclipsed 1000 points (or 10 correct answers), otherwise you will receive a losing message and be prompted to not be a chicken and *Try Again*!

### Technologies used in the making of this game:
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## Next Steps
- Future enhancements of this game would include a much bigger selection of food trivia questions, in order to make the game longer and more challenging. It is possible that by using an API, the game could have access to a great database of trivia questions of varying difficulties.

- Another goal for the future development of the game is to include some animations for the *Start* screen, and for the *Winning/Losing* screens as well.  This could be an animated chicken giving the user either a thumbs-up or thumbs-down depending whether the user met the winning conditions of the game or not.

- Another enhancement which could be a fun addition would be a leaderboard if there is a larger library of questions with more difficulty.
