//Steps for building - things needed:

//HTML: questions/ multiple choice answers, submit answer(btn), score total (input)

//CSS: grid? style page and buttons(questions/submit answer/points/win-lose)

//Pseudocode
//Set up an array of objects containing {question/multiple choices/answer} data

//Set up cached elements - question, choices, submit answer, audio

//Have a scoreboard with a value added for a question answered correctly, and total score
// -----how does a player lose? negative points for incorrect? need to get 5 correct in a row for winning condition?

//Functions:
//Click a button and get a random question with  multiple choices
//Need to be able to choose an answer
//Need to be able to submit answer
//Need score to update with correct/incorrect answer

//Need a function for win/lose - show a result. How to win? 
//If you score > 80% then you win? Or if you get 5 questions in a row you win?

//Need to initialize the game
//Need a callback to call the audio for 'correct' or 'incorrect' answer

//Event listeners
//'click' on the different buttons for multiple choices
//'click' to submit answer
//
